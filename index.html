        <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>
        <p>I have a passion for web design and graphics. I enjoy making websites especially for small businesses that cannot afford to hire professional web developers. I not only design websites but code them! I learned these skills from my time at The New Jersey Institute of Technology and taking online courses through Code Academy. I have always been a creative person as I love to use my imagination and bring my visions to life. Yet, I would also consider myself to be a “tech savvy” person. Web design helps me bring both of my worlds to life.</p>
