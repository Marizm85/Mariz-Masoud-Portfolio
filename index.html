        <p>
          I have a passion for web design and graphics. I enjoy making websites especially for small businesses that cannot afford to hire professional web developers. I not only design websites but code them! I learned these skills from my time at The New Jersey Institute of Technology and taking online courses through Code Academy. I have always been a creative person as I love to use my imagination and bring my visions to life. Yet, I would also consider myself to be a “tech savy” person. Web design helps me bring both of my worlds to life.

          I worked on this website as a project to showcase my creative capabilities, honing in on my web graphics/design skills rather than solely focusing on the coding aspect of web development. This website portrays a possible businesses idea with a possible website.
